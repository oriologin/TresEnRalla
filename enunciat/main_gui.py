#     if the square at these coordinates is free, moves the selected  
#     stone there, changes player, unselects the stone and checks for 
#     end of game; otherwise, does nothing, leaving the stone selected;
#     returns: bool "stone still selected", next player (may be the same), 
#     and bool "end of game"
